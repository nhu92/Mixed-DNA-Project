1. find the position of the input taxa name
2. judge: if the sister group contains any taxa without "NODE". True goto 4; False goto 3
3. move the current clade to the upper clade
4. record the taxa name of the current clade
5. move the current clade to the upper clade
6. judge: if the support value of this clade is above 0.7. True goto 7; False goto 4
7. return the list of recorded taxa name, remove any taxa contains "NODE"

1. reroot the tree by the taxa contains "Amborella"
2. if not found reroot by the taxa contains "Nymphaea"
3. if not found reroot by the taxa contains "Austrobaileya"
4. if all not found then reroot by midpoint

1. screen all the taxa names that contain "NODE" in the tree using find_clade_and_move(tree, taxa_name)
2. output a text file formatted as: unknown species name(the NODE one): recorded taxa name1; recorded taxa name2, ...
3. save the output file handled by argparse

1. read in a text file
2. each line formatted as: unknown species name: recorded taxa name1; recorded taxa name2, ...
3. for each unknown species, check the overlap of the recorded taxa name in the text file and the outliers from similarity
4. set the non-overlapped similarity into 0
